# Hindu Temples

This project delves into the rich tapestry of Hindu temples, showcasing their architectural grandeur, cultural significance, and spiritual importance. Through two JSON data files located in the 'data' directory, this project provides detailed information about temples dedicated to various deities and the states in which they reside. Additionally, two helper Python scripts assist in parsing and presenting the temple data.

    - **info:** A brief introduction to the deity and its temples
    - **story:** The origin story or history associated with the deity
    - **visiting_guide:** A guide for visiting temples dedicated to the deity
    - **architecture:** A description of the architectural features of temples dedicated to the deity
    - **mention_in_scripture:** References to the deity in Hindu scriptures

2. **states.json:** This file presents an overview of states in India that are known for their Hindu temples. For each state, the file includes the following data:
    - **name:** The name of the state
    - **temples:** A list of temples located in the state
    - **info:** A brief introduction to the state and its temples
    - **story:** Historical or history anecdotes related to the temples and the state
    - **visiting_guide:** A guide for visiting temples in the state
    - **architecture:** A description of the architectural styles found in temples in the state
    - **mention_in_scripture:** References to temples in the state in Hindu scriptures

## Helper Scripts

In addition to the JSON data files, this repository also includes two Python helper scripts:

- `states_helper.py`: This script provides functions to access and manipulate the data in the `states.json` file.
- `deities_helper.py`: This script provides functions to access and manipulate the data in the `deities.json` file.

## Usage

To use this repository, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python packages.
3. Open a Python console and import the helper scripts.
4. Use the functions in the helper scripts to access and manipulate the data.

You can then utilize the obtained data to display information about Hindu temples and deities in your own applications or visualizations.


### Note

Both JSON data files are large and may take a few seconds to load. Please be patient while the data is being processed.
