* Ravana was overjoyed with his new boon. He immediately went to Mount Kailash, where Shiva resides, and brought the lingam of Shiva to Lanka. He placed the lingam on his head and became invincible.
* The gods were worried about Ravana's new power. They went to Vishnu for help. Vishnu devised a plan to defeat Ravana. He incarnated as a beautiful woman named Mohini and went to Lanka. Mohini was so beautiful that Ravana was immediately smitten with her. He invited her to stay with him.
* Mohini spent some time with Ravana and gradually gained his trust. One day, she asked Ravana to let her see the lingam of Shiva. Ravana agreed and removed the lingam from his head and gave it to Mohini.
* As soon as Mohini got the lingam in her hands, she threw it on the ground. The lingam fell into the ground and disappeared. Ravana was furious and tried to attack Mohini, but she disappeared.

**The Origin of Jagannath Temple, Puri**

The Jagannath Temple in Puri, Odisha, is one of the most sacred Hindu temples dedicated to Lord Jagannath, an incarnation of Vishnu. The temple is believed to have been built in the 12th century by King Anantavarman Chodaganga Deva of the Eastern Ganga dynasty. However, according to Hindu mythology, the temple is said to have been built by Indra, the king of the gods, in order to house the Sudarshan Chakra, a powerful weapon of Vishnu.

**The Story of the Sudarshan Chakra**

One day, Indra was playing a game of dice with the demon king Bali. Bali was winning, and Indra was becoming increasingly frustrated. In a fit of rage, Indra threw the Sudarshan Chakra at Bali, cutting off his head. Bali's body fell to the ground, but his head continued to fly through the air. Indra chased after it, but the head was too fast for him. Finally, Indra gave up and returned to heaven.

The head of Bali landed in the village of Puri, where it was found by a fisherman named Sudarshan. Sudarshan took the head to his home and placed it on a banana leaf. The next morning, he found that the head had turned into a beautiful statue of Vishnu. Sudarshan realized that this was a sign from the gods, and he built a temple to house the statue. This temple is the Jagannath Temple, which is still standing today.

Agastya tried to reason with Bhandasura, but the demon refused to listen. Finally, Agastya was forced to kill Bhandasura.

After killing Bhandasura, Agastya decided to build a temple to Shiva, the god of destruction. He chose a hilltop near the Godavari River as the site for the temple. Agastya then began to dig a pit for the foundation of the temple. However, as he dug, he found that the pit was bottomless. Agastya realized that this was a sign from Shiva, who did not want the temple to be built.

Agastya was disappointed, but he knew that he had to obey Shiva's wishes. He abandoned the project and left the hilltop. However, Shiva was impressed by Agastya's devotion and decided to bless him. Shiva appeared to Agastya and told him that he would build the temple himself. Shiva then created a Shivalinga out of sand and installed it on the hilltop.

The Shivalinga that Shiva created is said to be the oldest in the world. It is also said to be one of the most powerful. The temple that was built around the Shivalinga is known as Sri Bhramaramba Mallikarjuna Swamy Temple.

In the beginning, there was a great drought that was causing great suffering for all living beings. The gods and demons decided to churn the ocean of milk in order to obtain amrita, the nectar of immortality. Mount Mandara was used as the churning stick, and Vasuki, the king of the serpents, was used as the rope. The gods pulled on Vasuki's head, while the demons pulled on his tail. After churning for a long time, they finally obtained amrita. However, before the gods could drink it, the demons stole it. The gods then appealed to Vishnu for help. Vishnu took the form of Mohini, the most beautiful woman in the universe. Mohini tricked the demons into drinking a potion that turned them into stone. The gods then drank the amrita and became immortal.

* **The Birth of Goddess Yamuna:**

After the gods had become immortal, they decided to divide the amrita among themselves. However, a few drops of amrita fell to the ground. These drops of amrita became the rivers Ganga, Yamuna, and Saraswati. Goddess Yamuna was born from the drops of amrita that fell on the earth. She is the sister of Yama, the god of death. Goddess Yamuna is considered to be the most sacred river in India. She is also considered to be the goddess of purity and beauty.
